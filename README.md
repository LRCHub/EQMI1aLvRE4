[00:04.91] Someday at Christmas, men won't be boys
[00:10.41] Playing with bombs like kids play with toys
[00:15.13] One warm December, our hearts will see
[00:20.02] A world where men are free
[00:33.02] 
[00:24.81] Someday at Christmas, there'll be no wars
[00:29.90] When we have learned what Christmas is for
[00:34.67] When we have found what life's really worth
[00:39.07] There'll be peace on Earth
[00:52.07] 
[00:44.14] Someday all our dreams will come to be
[00:49.22] Someday in a world where men are free
[00:53.77] Maybe not in time for you and me
[00:58.21] But someday at Christmastime
[01:12.21] 
[01:03.13] Someday at Christmas, we'll see a land
[01:08.24] With no hungry children, no empty hand
[01:12.84] One happy morning, people will share
[01:17.61] Our world where people care
[01:31.11] 
[01:22.06] Someday at Christmas, there'll be no tears
[01:27.09] All men are equal and no men have fears
[01:31.74] One shining moment, one prayer away
[01:36.27] From our world today
[01:46.27] 
[01:40.95] Someday all our dreams will come to be
[01:45.79] Someday in a world where men are free
[01:50.43] Maybe not in time for you and me
[01:54.86] But someday at Christmastime
[02:08.86] 
[01:59.88] Someday at Christmas, man will not fail
[02:04.55] Hate will be gone and love will prevail
[02:09.27] Someday a new world that we can start
[02:13.80] With hope in every heart
[02:25.80] 
[02:18.68] (Someday all our dreams will come to be)
[02:23.54] (Someday in a world where men are free)
[02:28.11] Maybe not in time for you and me
[02:32.47] But someday at Christmastime
[02:37.16] Someday at Christmastime
